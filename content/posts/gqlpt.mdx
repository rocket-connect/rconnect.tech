GQLPT is an innovative npm package that leverages the power of AI to generate GraphQL queries from plain text. This cutting-edge tool is designed to streamline the development process and make working with GraphQL more accessible and efficient for developers of all levels.

## What is GQLPT?

GQLPT is a powerful npm package that allows developers to generate GraphQL queries using natural language. Instead of manually constructing complex queries, you can simply describe what data you need in plain English, and GQLPT will do the heavy lifting for you.

## Key Features

1. AI-Powered Query Generation: GQLPT uses advanced AI models to interpret your plain text descriptions and generate accurate GraphQL queries.

2. Flexible Adapters: The package supports multiple AI services through its adapter system. Currently, it offers adapters for Anthropic and OpenAI.

3. Schema Introspection: GQLPT can connect directly to your GraphQL endpoint and introspect the schema, ensuring that generated queries are always up-to-date.

4. Generate and Send: With the generateAndSend method, GQLPT can not only generate queries but also send them directly to your GraphQL endpoint.

5. Bring Your Own AI: GQLPT operates on a "bring your own AI" model. You need to supply your own API key for either OpenAI or Anthropic to use their respective adapters.

## GQLPT in Action

Here's a glimpse of the GQLPT playground in action:

We encourage you to try out the GQLPT playground at [gqlpt.dev](https://www.gqlpt.dev/). It's a great way to experience the power of AI-generated GraphQL queries firsthand!

## Getting Started with GQLPT

Let's walk through the process of setting up and using GQLPT in your project:

### Installation

First, install GQLPT and the OpenAI adapter:

```bash
npm install gqlpt @gqlpt/adapter-openai
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use GQLPT:

```typescript
import { AdapterOpenAI } from "@gqlpt/adapter-openai";
import { GQLPTClient } from "gqlpt";

const typeDefs = /* GraphQL */ `
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }

  type Query {
    user(id: ID!): User
  }
`;

const client = new GQLPTClient({
  typeDefs,
  adapter: new AdapterOpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, // Make sure to provide your OpenAI API key
  }),
});

async function main() {
  await client.connect();
  const query = "Find users by id 1";
  const response = await client.generateQueryAndVariables(query);
  console.log(response);
}

main();
```

Note: Remember to supply your own OpenAI API key in the above example.

### Using Introspection

GQLPT can fetch your schema directly from your GraphQL endpoint:

```typescript
const client = new GQLPTClient({
  url: "http://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql",
  adapter: new AdapterOpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),
});

await client.connect(); // Performs introspection
```

### Generate and Send

For a complete end-to-end solution, use the generateAndSend method:

```typescript
const response = await client.generateAndSend("Find users by id 1");
console.log(response); // Logs the server's response
```

## Real-World Benefits

1. Faster Development: Spend less time writing complex queries and more time building features.
2. Improved Accessibility: Make GraphQL more accessible to team members who might not be GraphQL experts.
3. Reduced Errors: AI-generated queries can help reduce syntax errors and improve query accuracy.
4. Flexibility: Easily switch between different AI providers using the adapter system.
