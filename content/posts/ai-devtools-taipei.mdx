## Featured Speakers

The event features three exciting talks from industry experts in AI tooling, graph databases, and API development.

### Dan Starns - MCP RAG: Intelligent Tool Discovery at Scale

[Rocket Connect](https://www.rconnect.tech)

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielstarns/)

Dan will demonstrate MCP RAG, a groundbreaking approach to managing large AI toolsets using graph-based vector search. Learn how Neo4j-powered semantic search dramatically reduces context overhead when working with extensive tool libraries. See live benchmarks showing improved efficiency and performance while maintaining accuracy across 90+ tools. Perfect for developers building scalable AI applications with complex tool ecosystems.

### Adam Chan - [Talk to be announced]

[HackerSquad](https://hackersquad.io/)
