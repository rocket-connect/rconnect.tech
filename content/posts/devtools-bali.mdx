## Talks

### Over-Dependent on External Libraries or Packages: Why You Shouldn't Do That

- Wahyu Ivan

This talk will discuss why junior software engineers should avoid relying too heavily on external libraries or packages, as it can lead to numerous problems in the future and result in a shallow understanding of how to write code. Additionally, this topic is inspired by debates on Twitter about nowadays junior software engineers who simply just importing packages or libraries and calling it "writing code," when in reality, they are just using someone else's code.
