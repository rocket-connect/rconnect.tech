Output quality of AI depend on how well components work together. This talk demonstrates how to evaluate pipelines built on Neo4j MCP servers, using promptfoo for structured evals, and testing multi-agent frameworks like CrewAI and LangGraph using various models and inference providers. We'll explore methods to identify the highest-quality combinations of agents, prompts, and infrastructure for selecting the most efficient pipelines.

### Neo4j MCP Server Deep Dive
