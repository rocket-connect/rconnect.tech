### Generative AI with Knowledge Graphs

- Ankit Upadhyay

Tech enthusiast with a degree and dreamsâ€”probably more of the latter. Juggling between coding and binge-watching, I believe in leaving a mark through witty code and perfectly timed punchlines. On a mission to redefine tech norms, because why be serious when you can code with a side of laughter? Let's break the binary together!
